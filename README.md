Project Code Name: Functional Wish
Project Name: GPT-3 based Unity Assets Generation from Text (Open Source)
About the Project:

The goal of this project is to create a system that allows users to generate Unity3D assets using GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) based on text input. This system will allow users to input a description or specification of the desired asset, and GPT-3 will generate the necessary code and assets for the user to import into their Unity3D project. To start, we will need to set up a connection to GPT-3 and establish the necessary API key and access. We will also need to research and determine the most effective way to input text and receive generated assets from GPT-3. Once the connection to GPT-3 is established, we will need to create a user interface that allows users to input their desired asset description and specify any necessary parameters or options. The user interface will also need to have a way to display the generated assets and code for the user to review and import into their project. To ensure the generated assets are of high quality and meet the user&#39;s specifications, we will need to conduct thorough testing and debugging of the system. This may involve refining the input text and adjusting the parameters and options available to users.
